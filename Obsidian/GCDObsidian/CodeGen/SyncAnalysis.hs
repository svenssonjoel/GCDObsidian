   SyncAnalysis. 

   Try to decide automatically whether a Sync is needed or not. 
   *** This will make sence in the CUDA case. For OpenCL generation 
       use the programmer-placed syncs. (This is why the Synchronize 
       constructor in the Program datatype now has a boolean parameter. 
   
   The method I use to decide if a Sync is needed or not is:
    When Array 'arr' is computed, if a thread, t1, that computes 
    an element uses any element owned by* a thread, t2, such 
    that (t1 `div` WarpSize /= t2 `div` WarpSize) that has not 
    yet been synced. 
      If so, a sync is needed before t1 performs the computation. 
    *Owned by means having been computed by. 

   
   To implement the above method I use two maps and a single pass 
     over the Program datastructure. 
   SAMap contains at anytime all the arrays that have not yet been synced    
      it maps  array-names to a TEMap 
   TEMap is a Index to ThreadId  that for every index remembers what 
      thread computed it. 

   So when computing location tid in an array, every array and index 
   that that location depends on is found. The array-names are used 
   to make lookups into SAMap followed by looking up the in the TEMap 
   using the index. If the thread obtained is in another warp a sync 
   is inserted and the SAMap cleared. 
   
   The array currently being computed is added to the SAMap and no 
   sync is inserted following its computation. 

  
   Future:
     * Once we start to write data-dependent assignment locations (like filters) 
       The implementation needs an update to work. 
       One way to take care of this might be to simply say that if the index 
       cannot be evaluated here it is data-dependent and a sync should be used. 
       (see eval and evalSource, local functions in analyseForAll) 
     
     * The implementation does not understand nested ForAll loops.
       If we ever use nested ForAlls this needs to change. 


     ERROR!!! 
       My assumptions about when it was safe not to sync are faulty! 
       This needs more thought!
